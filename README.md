## Invidious Playlist Duration

This Firefox add-on shows total duration of playlists in [Invidio.us](https://github.com/omarroth/invidious) web app.

*Note*: This add-on does not work for playlists with more than 100 videos because it queries the [Invidio.us API](https://github.com/omarroth/invidious/wiki/API) for lengths of videos. View this [issue](https://github.com/omarroth/invidious/issues/1260).
